<p>For my evaluation I have chosen Star Wars Empire At War (EAW). A Huristics analasis was chosen for this task, specifically heuristics set out by Jakob Nielsens that were published in 1994 in the book Useability Engineering.
I have chosen this approach as it contains a broad set of heurisitcs that can cover most every UI. EAW is an RTS game that requires a mouse and keyboard to play, It was a considered a succesful game with very positicve reviews.
A point to note here is that EAW has had very many extensive mods applied to the game.
<p></p>

<p></p>
Many to all of the most popular ones don't change the UI at all, which suggests that the
player base for this game is very happy with the set-up for this UI, through this evaluation I will use heuristic analasys to find out why.
</p>

          <h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1: Visibility of system status:</h3>
<p>Looking at the ingame events in EAW when a ship loses a Hardpoint (HP)(Weapon or utility), a sounds is played which informs you of this.
For example when a ship loses their  engine you will be informed that that ship has lost its engine. Look at 2:28.
<p></p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/acygLZ2GFdc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p></p>
This can be very helpfull when commaninf many capital ships although if too many are loosing HP's the game can be a bit overwhelming with sounds for the player.
When a capital ship of yours or the enemy appears on the map, it will be indicated by a large red dot on the minimap. This is very usefull when when playing an RTS to be informed of a danger of this caliber.
<p></p>
<img src="images/Minimap.jpg" alt="Minimap Showing Enemy Capital Ships" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
<p></p>
As also can be seen here are the bright red dots, these indicate areas that your units are under fire.
This can get confusing and lead to micro-management, although from the survey this method tends to be prefered in RTS.
</p>

        <h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2: Match between system and the real world:</h3>
<p>
From the survey, just using some screenshots and a short video, players seem to find the UI
easy and simple to navigate. This indicates the system has a logical sense to it and a natural feel.
</p>

        <h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3:User control and freedom:</h3>
<p>
In EAW the player can command individual units to use their special abilities through the rather unique UI.
Even with all of the units selected the player can command individual units by simply clicking on their icon, or just use their abilities.
<p></p>
<img src="images/UI_Power.jpg" alt="Minimap Showing Enemy Capital Ships" style="width:800px;height:200px;">
<p></p>
This gives the player more control over how the battle will go, rather than having to click on each individual unit to use their ability,
this does have its drawbacks, for example: the powers are limited by two per unit otherwise it begins to fill up the UI and can become confusing.

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4: Consistency and standards:</h3>
<p>
With the picture above in mind the powers ingame are represented with the same images, providing a consistency which aids the player in making their moves.
E.g. the missile ability (Left) essentially has the same outcome as a ground unit which is very different in its capabilities. But as the icon shows, the ability is just a missile barrage.
</p>

        <h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5: Error prevention:</h3>
<p>
Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.
Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
</p>

        <h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>6: Recognition rather than recall:</h3>
<p>
With EAW a method that is used for helping the user recognise the strengths and weaknesses of
each unit rather than trying to remember them is by showing them above the minimap as shown below.
<p></p>
<img src="images/Unit_Info.jpg" alt="Minimap Showing Enemy Capital Ships" style="width:400px;height:600px;">
<p></p>
Another point to make is the reinforcements indicator above the unit info, this shows the user what
reinforcements they have at their disposal rather than relying on their memory.
A downfall for this ui is that there is no obvious indicator for how many of which unit you have unless you select all units.
</p>

        <h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>7: Aesthetic and minimalist design:</h3>
<p>
Referring back to the picture of the unit info, there is some useless information on some units
i.e. the ground units as the player does not need to know this info other than the size of the squad.
This is the opposite for the capital ships for space battles as the player is informed of the amount of hard points and fighter that that ship carries.
<p></p>
<img src="images/UI_Cost.jpg" alt="Minimap Showing Enemy Capital Ships" style="width:800px;height:200px;">
<p></p>
When selecting the production buildings it is simple for the player to see what they want to build as well as the cost of each unit,
this keeps the screen simple and clear. Although from the survey it was commented that the UI took up too much of the screen, when compared to SC the Ui doesn't take up that much room.
<p></p>
<img src="images/SC_UI.jpg" alt="Minimap Showing Enemy Capital Ships" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
</p>

        <h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>8: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:</h3>
<p>
When the player makes a mistake, for example when calling in reinforcements if the player does not drag them into the circle correctly,
the action is canceled and the only indication of this is a voice clip. This can make the situation frustrating for the player when under pressure
they have to continuously attempt to drag the unit into the circle to call them.
